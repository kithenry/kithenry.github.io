_ABOUT ME_

I'm a Computer Programmer. I like programming for how many problems I can efficiently solve with it. From alarm systems to wake me up and solve my snooze problem with C and Arduino to efficient short note organization and storage management with ssh, python, obsidian and apis from telegram. The list keeps growing. 

_Experience_

I've been solving problems with code for 4+ years now. Currently in my 4th year getting some formal training (A bachelor's degree) and paper work to add to and improve my skills.

_Languages_

As for which language I am most proficient with.. It's mostly been python, but I recently (2 or so months in now as I write this) started learning some C++ since I realized how important it would be for my Robotics Engineering aspirations. I do HTML and CSS and have built some websites with bootstrap, some linked in the project section. I am also familiar with Python's Flask and Django frameworks from my Software Engineering course unit Book Swapping project.
